	abstract = {We analyze the convergence aspects of the invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF), when the latter is used as a deterministic nonlinear observer on Lie groups, for continuous-time systems with discrete observations. One of the main features of invariant observers for left-invariant systems on Lie groups is that the estimation error is autonomous. In this paper we first generalize this result by characterizing the (much broader) class of systems for which this property holds. For those systems, the Lie logarithm of the error turns out to obey a linear differential equation. Then, we leverage this “log-linear” property of the error evolution, to prove for those systems the local stability of the IEKF around any trajectory, under the standard conditions of the linear case. One mobile robotics example and one inertial navigation example illustrate the interest of the approach. Simulations evidence the fact that the EKF is capable of diverging in some challenging situations, where the IEKF with identical tuning keeps converging.},

	abstract = {The Kalman filter—or, more precisely, the extended Kalman filter (EKF)—is a fundamental engineering tool that is pervasively used in control and robotics and for various estimation tasks in autonomous systems. The recently developed field of invariant extended Kalman filtering uses the geometric structure of the state space and the dynamics to improve the EKF, notably in terms of mathematical guarantees. The methodology essentially applies in the fields of localization, navigation, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Although it was created only recently, its remarkable robustness properties have already motivated a real industrial implementation in the aerospace field. This review aims to provide an accessible introduction to the methodology of invariant Kalman filtering and to allow readers to gain insight into the relevance of the method as well as its important differences with the conventional EKF. This should be of interest to readers intrigued by the practical application of mathematical theories and those interested in finding robust, simple-to-implement filters for localization, navigation, and SLAM, notably for autonomous vehicle guidance.},

	abstract = {A Lie group is an old mathematical abstract object dating back to the XIX century, when mathematician Sophus Lie laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups. Its inﬂuence has spread over diverse areas of science and technology many years later. In robotics, we are recently experiencing an important trend in its usage, at least in the ﬁelds of estimation, and particularly in motion estimation for navigation. Yet for a vast majority of roboticians, Lie groups are highly abstract constructions and therefore difﬁcult to understand and to use.},
